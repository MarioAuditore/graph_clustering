This repository presents you Filtration Clustering - graph clustering algorithm based on filtration process. The proposed method constructs a Vietoris-Rips filtration to generate a sequence of simplicial complexes. Basically, it is a generalization of graphs, where vertices can be groupped in larger sets:
- Vertices - $\{v_i\}$ 0-dim simplexes
- Edges - $\{v_i, v_j\}$ 1-dim simplexes
- Triangles - $\{v_i, v_j, v_q\}$ 2-dim simplexes

Core idea of Vietoris-Rips filtration is to dynamically increase distance threshold $\epsilon$ and add edges between close enough points, such that $d(a,b) \leq \epsilon$. Here is visualization [^1]:

Filtration Clustering applies a modified clique percolation technique [^2] to detect clusters as dense regions of triangles (2-simplices). By analyzing the evolution of clusters across filtration thresholds, the algorithm directly optimizes clustering quality metric. This approach uniquely treats the filtration process as a search space for clustering optimization, a novel view on graph clustering.
